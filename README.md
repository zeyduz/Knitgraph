Knitgraph is a Python-based toolkit for modeling and visualizing knitted fabrics using graph data structures. Each loop, stitch, and yarn connection is represented as a node or edge, enabling detailed simulation and analysis of knit patterns. Ideal for digital textile design, machine knitting, and computational fabrication, Knitgraph lets you generate, manipulate, and debug knit structures programmatically.
