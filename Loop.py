"""The Loop data structure"""


class Loop:
    """
    A class to represent a single loop structure.
    Loops can be twisted (but no possible on knitting machines, so defaults to false).
    Loops must be assigned a yarn parent.
    The layer of a loop defines its position relative to other loops, for instance, in cables and gauged sheets. Default to 0.
